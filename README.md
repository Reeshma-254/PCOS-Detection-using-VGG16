PCOS Detection Using Ultrasound Images

This project develops a deep learning-based classifier to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using ultrasound images. The solution is built with TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging VGG16 as the base model via transfer learning. Images are processed and normalized using OpenCV. The dataset is downloaded via Kaggle API.

Features: VGG16-based image classifier Transfer learning with custom top layers Data preprocessing and augmentation Handles Kaggle dataset download and extraction Model evaluation with visualization

Project Goals:

Build an AI model to detect PCOS from ultrasound images
Use VGG16 as the base model (transfer learning)
Train the model with high accuracy
Save the trained model
Create a simple inference script to predict new images
Upload project to GitHub for sharing
Requirements: tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib tqdm scikit-learn
